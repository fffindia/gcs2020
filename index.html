India is amongst the countries which are severely bearing the brunt of climate change.. Extreme weather events during the past few months – such as locust swarms, intensified cyclones like super cyclone Amphan, devastating floods in Assam, Maharashtra and Bihar – have only worsened the situation. The total number of Indians who were internally displaced due to natural disasters crossed an astonishing 5 million in 2019 according to the ‘Lost at Home’ report by UNICEF.

It has been ten years since the National Action Plan for Climate Change (NAPCC) was formulated to address mitigation tactics for such natural calamities, but there is little clarity on how it has fared. The rushed manner in which it was done resulted in merely providing broad objectives without addressing strategy.

The NAPCC, along with the MOEFCC, with its track record of environmentally harmful governance, appear to be oblivious to the threat of changing climatic conditions and Global Warming. 

We cannot follow or fall into the same development strategy which has created this crisis and neglects the basic needs of this country's citizens. Clean air, clean water and protection from climate change related natural calamities for all Citizens is a must. 

As a concerned citizen I feel that the NAPCC should function in a people-centric and Earth-centric way, rather than it being another economic victory for large industries. The budgets for the State and National Action Plan are allocated for large companies to invest in renewable energy and urban planning. These are the same companies which are some of the major contributors for the climate crisis and its various social and ecological consequences, the key question is why are certain industries and companies granted full impunity?  They need to be made accountable and course correction is necessary. 

It is also my concern that the various goals set in the NAPCC – for example – rejuvenation of water bodies, setting up of monitoring stations, releasing of funds for different schemes, etc – have been severely under met. 

This inadequacy of implementation spells grave danger for the country in the face of climate change and is also in violation of India’s international climate commitments.

I request you to consider the above-mentioned arguments, and give urgent priority to the implementation of the NAPCC, divesting from ecologically destructive companies, in a socially just and localized manner – keeping in mind the long term welfare of our country’s diverse ecologies, local communities and future generations.

 Yours Truly,
 Concerned Citizens

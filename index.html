			var body = `Dear Shri Prakash Javadekar,

India is amongst the countries which are severely bearing the brunt of climate change.. Extreme weather events during the past few months – such as locust swarms, intensified cyclones like super cyclone Amphan, devastating floods in Assam, Maharashtra and Bihar – have only worsened the situation. The total number of Indians who were internally displaced due to natural disasters crossed an astonishing 5 million in 2019 according to the ‘Lost at Home’ report by UNICEF.

It has been ten years since the National Action Plan for Climate Change (NAPCC) was formulated to address mitigation tactics for such natural calamities, but there is little clarity on how it has fared. The rushed manner in which it was done resulted in merely providing broad objectives without addressing strategy.

The NAPCC, along with the MOEFCC, with its track record of environmentally harmful governance, appear to be oblivious to the threat of changing climatic conditions and Global Warming. 

We cannot follow or fall into the same development strategy which has created this crisis and neglects the basic needs of this country's citizens. Clean air, clean water and protection from climate change related natural calamities for all Citizens is a must. 

As a concerned citizen I feel that the NAPCC should function in a people-centric and Earth-centric way, rather than it being another economic victory for large industries. The budgets for the State and National Action Plan are allocated for large companies to invest in renewable energy and urban planning. These are the same companies which are some of the major contributors for the climate crisis and its various social and ecological consequences, the key question is why are certain industries and companies granted full impunity?  They need to be made accountable and course correction is necessary. 

It is also my concern that the various goals set in the NAPCC – for example – rejuvenation of water bodies, setting up of monitoring stations, releasing of funds for different schemes, etc – have been severely under met. 

This inadequacy of implementation spells grave danger for the country in the face of climate change and is also in violation of India’s international climate commitments.

I request you to consider the above-mentioned arguments, and give urgent priority to the implementation of the NAPCC, divesting from ecologically destructive companies, in a socially just and localized manner – keeping in mind the long term welfare of our country’s diverse ecologies, local communities and future generations.

 Yours Truly,
 Concerned Citizens

    <h4>Subject: Request to Withdraw Draft EIA 2020 in the interest of Environmental and Public Welfare</h4>
    Dear Shri. Prakash Javadekar,<br><br>

In March 2020, during the COVID pandemic and under your leadership, the MOEFCC had released the Draft EIA 2020 Notification, and I am writing to you today to unequivocally request that this draft be withdrawn on account of how destructive it can prove to be for the ecology and the people of our great nation. 
<br><br>
Though the notification states that it seeks to make the EIA process ‘more transparent and expedient’. But several renowned organizations, experts and the public have raised serious questions and concerns about the consequences, if such an amendment came into force. 
<br><br>
There is a lot of sound scientific research emerging, linking the present pandemic to the vast destruction of natural habitats – which among numerous other ecosystem services, also greatly buffer zoonotic diseases like COVID – 19. This is in the larger context of a global climate breakdown – repercussions of which our country is already witnessing many, including the devastating Supercyclone Amphan in the East and the cyclone Nisarga in the West. In this light, the Draft EIA 2020 caters purely to the ‘ease of doing business’ in India and does not address these larger looming issues. This also comes at a time when the Government is opening up all its sectors to private companies – entities neither elected by or directly accountable to the people. This takes power away from the people which goes against our democratic ideals.
<br><br>
The proposed notification considerably relaxes various guidelines, restrictions and safeguards which legally exist for our wilderness and local people. This is in contravention to the scope and spirit of Section 3 of the Environmental Protections Act (1986) itself. It seems to make circumstances strongly favourable to industrial and corporate interests. Pertinent examples of this are the allowance of post-facto clearances and the non-requirement of EIA for B2 projects, which include potentially harmful ones like river valley projects, tanneries, many chemical manufacturing units, petrochemical industries, expansion of national highways, etc. How can we expect the perpetrators of ecological crimes to keep themselves accountable? We cannot! It is understandable that the government is taking measures to counter the recent economic slowdown, but these measures need to be also cognizant of long term and far-reaching ecological and social impacts. This is not to mention that destruction of the environment is proven to be worse for the economy in the longer term.
<br><br>
While there has been some streamlining with respect to the categorisation of projects, the public consultation step has been severely undermined. This dilutes an important democratic process ensuring the welfare of stakeholders in the project areas. It is not reasonable to expect that the public can get informed opinions on such short timelines.
<br><br>
There are a number of other such exemptions given for industries and relaxations of restrictions, which presently exist as safeguards against destructive development. There is, as such, nothing in the notification which is for the protection and conservation of the environment itself and/or for public welfare. Clearing this draft would be an untold disaster for the long-term welfare of our nation and the world.
<br><br>
It is laudable that the Ministry has extended the notice period for public review of this notification upto August 11th, considering numerous public representations and the lockdown situation. I further request you to kindly consider the above-mentioned arguments and withdraw this notification, keeping in mind the long-term welfare of our country’s natural wealth, local communities, and future generations.
<br><br><br>

Regards,<br>
Concerned citizens
